## introduction

[A JavaScript library for building user interfaces](https://reactjs.org/)

## installation

Install nodeJS and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

`@Optional` install yarn [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)

> `npm or yarn`: npm is stronger, yarn is faster [read here](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/npm-vs-yarn)

**First Approach**

Clone the a starter repo.

```bash
git clone --branch=starter https://github.com/ZaynJarvis/HackNTU-React.git
```

If you are a coder,
don't say you don't know GitHub... register an account [here](https://github.com/)
and never say you don't know git... learn it [here](https://github.com/clarencecastillo/NTUOSS-GitWorkshop)

Coders are assumed to be able to use version control tools. At least most interviewers do.

---

**Second Approach**

Getting started with React starter template.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react
```

From above command `npx` is a package installer and executer come with npm (node package manager)
`create-react-app` is a package which help us to creat a react starter template
`my-react` is a random name that you can use to create the project, React don't allow you to create a project name with upper case.

And that's all you need to start a project!

#### A quick preview of React structure

> we reference the folder that package.json is in as the `'root folder' or '/'`. If you created React app using the above account root folder will be `my-react`

- development related configuration files put into the root folder e.g. linting configuration, testing configuration, README, Changelog
- deployment related files put into the
- React application source code in src
- `.test.js` / `.spec.js` are test files do to unit/ integration test, which is out of scope and not necessary in a Hackathon. However, testing is trivial in large scale / team based project
- `index.js` is the entry point of the React App
- `index.css` is the setting for react global style
- `serviceWorker` is for PWA (Progressive Web App), which cache the app in the client for offline support. Don't register serviceWorker when you are developing apps, cache will be a headache when you try to change stuff, [read here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/)
- `App.js` is our first react component
